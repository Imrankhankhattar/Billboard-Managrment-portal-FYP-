# Abstract
Billboards management system is a web-based application where billboard’s customers and billboard’s owners companies can communicate effectively with each other for ‘out of home’ and ‘digital out of home’ marketing. The system facilitates billboard owners to add their billboards to the system, display their billboards to the clients for booking, add payment details where they want to receive payment of bookings of billboards,  manage their billboards, and booking requests, and clients to view all billboards added to the system and book them. It also lets the customers and owners register to the website so that the profiles are maintained. The user can access and modify his/her profile. New users are provided with a signup option.
# Objectives
The project objective is to automate the manual booking system of billboards (book billboards online), and to develop a web-based billboard management portal where billboard’s customers and billboard owner companies can communicate effectively with each other.
# Problem Statement
Advertising can be described as a marketing strategy to promote a product or service to prospective customers. The aim of advertising is to reach out to people who will most likely be willing to pay for a product or a service rendered by a company. Some companies will most likely advertise their services or products on big billboards within cities to attract clients.The use of billboards for the purposes of advertisement is significant in reaching out to customers of the product. Unfortunately, there is no online portal for billboards management in Pakistan, owners have to maintain all records of customers manually and  customers have to visit billboard’s owner for booking, which requires manual work and process time. So the proposed system is a web-based management system to provide services to the customers and owners of billboards.
# Proposed Solution
We build a web application where both owners and customers can create their accounts. Billboards owners can add their billboards by adding billboard details i.e name, price, location,screen size and viewership count.When the customer logins, all the billboards are visible to him. He can search the billboard by name and location, then he can estimate the price by providing the start and end date of the booking. Customers will upload content(video/picture) to confirm order. After confirmation of the order, the content will go into the review section of the owner. Owner will accept or reject the content. After acceptance of the content, the customer will upload payment details of his booking which will be sent to the owner. On verification of payment details, the billboard booking will be completed.
