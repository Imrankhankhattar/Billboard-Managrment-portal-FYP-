# Abstract
Advertising can be described as a marketing strategy to promote a product or service to prospective customers. The aim of advertising is to reach out to people who will most likely be willing to pay for a product or a service rendered by a company. Some companies will most likely advertise their services or products on big billboards within cities to attract clients.Billboards management system is an online web-based portal for OOH (out of home) and DOOH (digital out of home) marketing.
# Objective
The main objective of the project is to develop a web-based billboard management
portal where customers and companies can communicate effectively with each other.
# Problem Statement
The use of billboards for the purposes of advertisement is significant in reaching out to
customers.Unfortunately there is no online portal for billboards management in our country :Pakistan,companies used to register customers and their bookings manually,so the proposed system is a web-based management system to provide services to the companies.
# Proposed Solution
The main objective is to build a platform for the billboard owners & customers. We will
build a website on which both owners & customers can create their accounts. Billboards owners can add their billboards by adding the details i.e price,location,availability & viewership count etc. When the customer will login ,all the billboards will be visible to him. He can search the billboard by location & category (digital or simple),then he can estimate the price by providing the number of days for which he wants to book a billboard. Customers will upload content(video/picture) to confirm order.After confirmation of the order, the content will go into the review section of the owner with a notification. Owners will accept/reject the content.Owner will give reason in the feedback section if he rejects the content.After acceptance of the content, the billboard booking will be completed.
